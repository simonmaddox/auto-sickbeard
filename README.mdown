# Auto-SickBeard

After getting fed up of having to manually create folders (and then add the show in the web UI) in order to add TV Shows to Sick Beard, I figured there had to be an easier way.

So, I created this. Simply enter the name of the show you'd like to start watching, and it'll be added to Sick Beard for you.


## To Use

You'll need to change the first two lines - namely:

- The path to your TV Shows directory
- The URL to SickBeard
